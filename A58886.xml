            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO' you have declared to ſome Friends, That you do not conceive your ſelf under any Obligation of Anſwering my firſt Letter, the Licenſing of a Book being (I perceive) but a Friendly Office, and a cheap one too, when Conſcience only and Reputation may be concern'd in it, and not obliging the Licenſer to boggle at any <hi>Calumnies</hi> he meets with in it, nor at any <hi>Falſhood</hi> that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes upon the Readers, tho' in a Concern of ſo high a nature as the True Faith and Eternal Salvation: However, I will tempt your good Nature and Civility once more, hoping that you may at leaſt make uſe of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s happy Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance; and when you are ſenſible that Five or Six Weeks En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors cannot ſuggeſt any Anſwer that may appear to Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic View, without betraying the weakneſs of your Cauſe, and the unwarrantable Methods us'd in its defence, you will find out ſome <hi>Honeſt Footman,</hi> who will not bluſh to own all the Wrong, and impertinent Reaſoning which muſt make up a ſeeming Anſwer.</p>
            <p>I am confident, how unkindly ſoever you may deal with others, that you owe Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſo much Deference, as not to Licenſe a Book Printed in his Defence, without his Peruſal and Allowance. Wherefore not to trouble the Footman, <hi>whoſe Circumſtances</hi> (as we are told) <hi>can expect but a ſmall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of time,</hi> I ſhall look on the Anſwers given by Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi>'s <hi>Second,</hi> as offered, or at leaſt owned by him, and Examin how he ſupports thoſe Principles by which I pretend that he overthrows, Firſt, <hi>All right uſe of Common Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a Catholic Principle, That he who has an Infallible Guide, need not miſtruſt him ſo, as to enquire farther, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be in the right Way, tho' he may and ought to improve himſelf in the knowledge of the Way he is directed in. Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> in oppoſition to this ſelf-evident Principle,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Preſervat. Fol.</hi> 3.</note> charges the Catholic Church with this great Crime, That <hi>it will not allow the reading of Heretical Books;</hi> adding, That <hi>God
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51079:4"/> not only allows, but requires it.</hi> This ſeemed to me extravagant, not to ſay impious, and to all thoſe who have inherited from St. <hi>Paul</hi> that Faith to which he exacts ſo firm and unwavering an adherency, that if an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach us<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 8.</note> any thing in oppoſition to it, we ought not to mind him, or to return him any other Anſwer than <hi>Anathema.</hi> How can, ſaid I, this poſitive Certainty ſtand with an Obligation of reading Heretical Books which oppoſe that Faith, to frame by them, and ſettle a Judgment? By what Text doth God deliver this Injunction? I asked farther, how ſtanding to the firſt Principles of <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> a Church that declares all Men bound <hi>to Judge for themſelves,</hi> could Countenance Laws which exact of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that they ſtand not to that their Judgment, but Comply againſt it; and that conſtrain their liberty of Judging by the dread of Excommunications, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrations, Impriſonments, Excluſion from the chiefeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of free-born Subjects, even by Hanging and Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: which is to make it Death not to act againſt a ſtrict Duty of Conſcience, acknowledg'd by the Perſecutors to be ſuch. Theſe were three material Queſtions; I waited Six Weeks for an Anſwer, and he returns me at laſt by his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man this wonderful one: <hi>That I leave out what was ſaid of the Bible. Dr.</hi> Sherlock <hi>blaming the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>for not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering her People to diſpute their Religion, or to read Heretical Books, nay not ſo much as to look into the Bible it ſelf; that I take it for granted, that all the Writings of Proteſtant Divines are Heretical Books, nay the Bible it ſelf too.</hi> I wonder not the Doctor ſhould give this his Anſwer by a Footman; he hath yet, I conceive, ſome remnants of Modeſty. But is there here one word of Anſwer to my three Queſtions? No, not a ſyllable, nor of Truth neither. I reflected on no Divines of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion; I found <hi>Heretical Books</hi> in the number of thoſe which he blames our Church for not recommending, and which he aſſures us God requires the reading of. This being an Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a new Coin, and a Proof of his own Invention, I ſhew'd the Unreaſonableneſs of the one, and asked an Inſtance of the other, paſſing by that trivial Calumny ſo often An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That <hi>the Catholic Church ſuffers not her People to look into the Bible it ſelf;</hi> which ſuppoſes that we lock up the Bible,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51079:4"/> as the <hi>Romans</hi> did their <hi>Sybillin Books,</hi> whereas many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are commanded by the Catholic Church, ſetting aſide all temporal Concerns, to make the reading of the Word of God their continual ſtudy, and to teach daily the Doctrin of it to thoſe who not having learnt to read, or being of too weak a Judgment to carry away the Senſe of a Book, or too much ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up by their Trades and Employs, by which they ſupport their Families, and earn themſelves a neceſſary Livelihood, have not the Leiſure or Capacity to gather the Articles of Chriſtian Belief, or the different Parts of Chriſtian Duties from it: for to all others, who conceive they may reap a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from it, leave is never deny'd to read the Bible, tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to that end into all vulgar Tongues.</p>
            <p>In the cloſe an Anſwer is attempted, and the Author of the <hi>Defence</hi> tells me, <hi>He is not content with an Implicit Faith; That we are commanded to try the Spirits, and to try all things.</hi> Theſe are the Texts produc'd to maintain Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s three Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>That we are obliged to read Heretical Books, That God commands it, That each one is to judge finally for himſelf.</hi> I offer the following Obſervations on theſe Texts to your ſecond thoughts.</p>
            <p>With reaſon St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands each Chriſtian <hi>to try all</hi>
               <note place="margin">Omnia probate, quod bonum eſt tenete. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. Nolite omni Spiritui credere, ſed probate Spiritus, ſi ex Deo ſunt. 1 <hi>Joan.</hi> 4. Quoniam multi Pſeudo-Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae exierunt in Mundum.</note> 
               <hi>things, and to retain what is good:</hi> And St. <hi>John</hi> in plainer terms, <hi>Not to credit every Spirit, but to try the Spirits, if they be of God;</hi> for, as St. <hi>John</hi> obſerves in that very place, <hi>many falſe Prophets have appeared in the World:</hi> And ſince '<hi>tis neceſſary that Hereſies ariſe,</hi> there will ever be many ſuch, <hi>the Miniſters of Satan,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> minds us, 2 <hi>Cor. 11. 15. transfiguring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves like unto the Miniſters of Juſtice.</hi> We ought not then to believe each Man that pretends to the pure Word of the Lord, to the Spirit of the Lord. The Queſtion is, How we ought to try theſe different Spirits? Each Man, ſays Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> is to read all Heretical as well as Orthodox Books, to hear all Falſe Prophets as well as the Teachers of Truth, Each ignorant Tradeſman, Husbandman, Day-Laborer, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving read the Bible, heard and read what the Diſſenting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines can ſay, is to Decide as Sovereign Judge, without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal:<note place="margin">Alii Prophetia, alii diſcretio Spirituum. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 20.</note> All are to chooſe thus their Religion.

That ſuch a Principle makes void all the right uſe of reaſon, when it ſhould lead us to ſubmit to a juſt Authority: that St. <hi>Paul</hi> pretended to Infallibility through the aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God who directed him, and conſequently, that if this Principle of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> be reaſonable, the <hi>Jews</hi> ought when he diſputed in their Synagouge, <hi>not to have ſtirr'd an inch,</hi> not to have hearkened to him, till he had diſowned infallibility. In the Defence, the Honeſt Footman is aſhamed of ſo unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian a Principle, and would diſown it, ſaying, <hi>That it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears plain and natural to him, that he may ſubmit his judgment to an Infallible Judge, and yet the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>may not be that Judge,</hi> true: but this is contrary to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For, how long is the Proteſtant <hi>not to ſtir an inch,</hi> till the Catholic hath proved his Churches infallibility?

               <hi>Preſervative, fol.</hi> 6. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> asks this Queſtion, <hi>What difference is there betwixt mens uſing their private judgment to turn</hi> Papiſts <hi>or to turn Proteſtants?</hi> I anſwered: the ſame as betwixt two ſick men, the one whereof chooſes to put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in an able Doctors hands, whom he knows to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Remedy, whilſt the other chooſes his own Simples, and makes his own Medicin. As between two at Law, the one whereof is guided by his Reaſon to take Advice from a wiſe Counſellor, the other to be his own Council, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Doctor</hi>'s <hi>ſecond</hi> Anſwers by this Queſtion, <hi>And is not here private Judgment uſed all this while?</hi> A ſhrewd Queſtion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> had asked <hi>what difference</hi> there was in theſe two uſes of private Judgment; I produce the difference,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51079:7"/> then as if the Queſtion had been forgot, ſtill ſays the <hi>Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> there is uſe made of private Judgment: it were as nice a Reply, had one asked what difference is there betwixt an Ounce of Gold and an Ounce of Silver, if when the different value is expreſs'd, he ſhould wiſely return this anſwer, why there is ſtill an Ounce in both caſes. Is there no difference then betwixt one who follows his fancy in chooſing his way, and him who chooſes a good Guide, and follows him, becauſe both chooſe? do both equally rely on their fancy? What Poſition can more abuſe common ſenſe? Certainly the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and Learned Gentlemen of the <hi>Temple,</hi> cannot but ſmile at this ſtrange way of Reaſoning in their Maſter, ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from theirs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſervative,</hi> fol. 9. <hi>They cannot with any ſenſe diſpute with us about the particular Articles of Faith, becauſe the ſenſe given of Scripture and Fathers, takes its Authority from the Church under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it ſo.</hi> I Replyed, that the ſenſe takes its Authority from God who ſpake the Word, though we are certain that we have the true ſenſe of that Word, becauſe we receive it from the Church, which is guided in delivering to us both the Letter and Senſe by the infallible Spirit of God, that is to abide with Her for ever, according to Chriſts promiſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 16. I added that if <hi>John</hi> and <hi>William</hi> diſpute, which is the right way to a place, <hi>John</hi> is not diſabled of convincing <hi>William</hi> of his miſtake, becauſe he receives the Reaſons he uſes from an infallible Guide. This was plain and full: what anſwers the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s <hi>ſecond,</hi> He cites ſome Catholic Divines (how truly, it belongs not to my preſent purpoſe) ſaying, that the words of Scripture brought in proof of <hi>Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi> might be taken in a different ſenſe from that which the Catholic Church hath ever received and delivered: and that had not the Church ever taught that ſenſe, one might believe otherwiſe for all the Letter of Scripture. Let it be ſo; but what follows here? But the neceſſity of an unerring Interpreter? So, that Text 1 <hi>Joh. 5. 7, 8. There be three which give Teſtimony in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three be one, and there be three which give teſtimony on Earth, the Spirit, Water, and Blood, and theſe three be one,</hi> in the ſenſe the Church hath ever received it in, proves
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51079:8"/> the ſtrict Unity of God in the Trinity of Perſons: The <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> gave it a contrary, and as natural a ſenſe; doth this prove that we follow not Scripture, and this very Text in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Holy Trinity? Once more I appeal to the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentlemen of the <hi>Temple,</hi> hoping they will join with me, maintaining againſt their Maſter, that all the Judges of the Land may very reaſonably convince by Law an impertinent Party, though he ſhould oppoſe that they may not do it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Interpretation of the Law, is to deliver the true ſenſe of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Preſervative,</hi> fol. 11. moves this Queſtion. <hi>Muſt the belief of an infallible Judge be reſolved into every mans private judgment? Muſt it not be believed with a Divine Faith, and can there be a Divine Faith without an infallible Judge?</hi> I gave this anſwer; There can be no Divine Faith, without a Divine Revelation, nor a prudent one without a Moral evidence in the Motives of Credibility, on which may be grounded the evident obligation to accept it. The judgment being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd with that Moral infallibility, reſts not there, but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that goodneſs and mercy of God, which cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that falſhood ſhould be propounded in his Name, with all the apparent marks of his Hand and Seal, and without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny like appearance on the Contrary, inclined by a pious motion of the Will, called by the famous Council of <hi>Orange affectio credibilitatis,</hi> and ſtrengthen'd by that Grace of God, which beſtows the <hi>Gift of Faith,</hi> faſtens on Gods Veracity, and with a ſubmiſſion not capable of any doubt, embraces the revealed truth. If the infallibility of the Church were more than Morally evident, it were impoſſible that any Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy ſhould be. To this the <hi>Second of Dr.</hi> Sherlock hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to oppoſe, and is willing to ſubmit if I can <hi>ſhew a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that there is an infallible viſible Church.</hi> I will comply with ſo reaſonable a demand: and ſince not one in a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of thoſe who oppoſe our Doctrin in this fundamental Point, which once being cleared, bears away all diſputes, underſtands what that infallibility means, on which we ground the admirable certainty of each Point of our Belief, give me leave Sir, to be ſomwhat more prolix on this Subject than the narrow compaſs of a Letter would otherwiſe allow.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>What is, and whence proceeds this infallibility?</hi> Many do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and object unto us, that we hold a Man, or many to be infallible in themſelves, a Title to which God alone can lay a Claim, who only as he is <hi>truth,</hi> ſo he is alone infallible. They wilfully ſuppoſe, that we place this infallibility in the ſenſe and judgment of men, ſo that whatever by their own Light they reſolve and order, muſt infallibly be true and juſt; that ſuch may frame new Articles of Faith, and a new Religion; or at leaſt <hi>Phanatick</hi>-like by Enthuſiaſms, and new marvelous Revelations, make new additions to our Faith, ſo that we may have daily a different one; their Votaries like a blind Herd, being driven now to one Opinion, then to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet ſtill ſuppoſing themſelves infallibly right; all this is a monſtruous miſrepreſentation, without one word of truth; but men who themſelves follow a lawleſs fancy, and looſe liberty, muſt thus disfigure that admirable Guide which God hath left us, otherwiſe they would ſoon be without any fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers: this account I ſhall deliver here of the infallible Guide, which Catholics follow, <hi>the Church of God,</hi> will I am ſure repreſent her in very different, becauſe in her true proper Colours.</p>
            <p>Our Guide then is the Catholic Church, either diffuſive in its whole extent, or repreſentative in its Head, and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, the Pope, and a General Council; for as in the State here in <hi>England,</hi> we have a <hi>Common Law,</hi> and a <hi>Statute Law,</hi> the firſt not compiled by any one Lawgiver, but delivered by all the Judges and Sages of the Law, and preſerved in all Courts, and the daily uſe of the whole Kingdom; the ſecond delivered particularly by the Kingdoms Great Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in its Head and Members, the King, and lawfully conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Parliaments. So in the Church there is a general Faith, firſt received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and preſerved by all Biſhops in their reſpective Dioceſſes, and in the mind and actions of each faithful Believer in the whole Catholic Church; and when any difficulty ariſes by the oppoſition of new Hereſies, then the Church Repreſentative the Pope, and a General Council, or Synod of the ableſt and Holieſt Biſhops of the Catholic Church, deliver their Sentence in favour of the ancient Truth ever followed in the Church,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51079:9"/> which Deciſions, or Canons, are like our Statute Law, only declaring, and applying to particular inſtances the Common Law, or Belief of the Church. We hold that this general Faith received from the Apoſtles, and preſerved in all the Members of the Catholic Church, explained upon occaſion by the Church Repreſentative is infallibly true, and this is all the infallibility the Catholic Church pretends unto, neither the whole Church, nor any perſon, or perſons in it, are held to poſſeſs any intrinſick infallibility, which we own to be proper to God alone. Nay no man in this preſent ſtate or condition of life, as our Divines obſerve, can be in himſelf <hi>impeccable,</hi> or <hi>infallible,</hi> all are of themſelves ſubject to Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,<note place="margin">

               <hi>holy Church, and Guides her.</hi> When God revealed to St. <hi>Paul</hi> that he ſhould come to <hi>Rome</hi> and die there, or to St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that being grown old he ſhould be Crucified: were either of them <hi>immortal,</hi> the one till he came to <hi>Rome,</hi> the other till he became old? not the leaſt, they were as ſrail as before,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51079:9"/> as expoſed to Diſeaſes within, as capable of being wounded and that mortally, yet in a true ſenſe they were <hi>immortal</hi> for that time, becauſe that by reaſon of the Revelation and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of God, it was impoſſible they ſhould die before they came the one to <hi>Rome,</hi> the other to old Age, according to the Revelation. Thus ſhould God reveal to a Traveller in a wild Wilderneſs full of wild Beaſts, and beſet by Thieves, that he ſhould <hi>paſs certainly</hi> unhurt, and not fall, he, nor thoſe who follow him, into the Hands of theſe, or Claws of thoſe; this man would remain as weak, as ignorant of the ways, as expoſed to danger as before, yet would prove an infallible Guide to thoſe who would follow him. So ſuppoſing (which I ſhall preſently prove) that God hath promiſed to the Catholic Church, that his holy Spirit ſhould guide her in all truth; that ſhe ſhall follow that true Guide, and ever avoid falling into Error, though each Member of the Church remain as fallible, as weak, as ſubject to Error as before; yet it evidently follows, that this Church will infallibly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void all Errors, never lead any of her followers into it; and this is all we mean by the Churches infallibility? A thing when thus rightly underſtood, as clear, as evident, as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, as that God's Revelation cannot prove falſe, as that the Holy Ghoſt and Chriſt himſelf (who remains with the Teachers of this Church) be in themſelves infallible. We do not expect any new Revelations or Lights; we do not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any new Article of Faith, though, where a doubt ariſes the Church hath infallibly power to declare what hath been revealed by Chriſt to the Apoſtles, and Preached by them, which perchance ſome part of the Church might have had a leſs clear underſtanding thereof, and though when the ſenſe of Scripture appears doubtful to ſome, this Church can explain infallibly what the true ſenſe and meaning is, and deliver more explicitly what is implyed in the Word of Scripture: for example, if ſome doubts whether in the Myſtery of our Lords Supper there be a true Change of the ſubſtance of Bread, into that of the Body of our Lord. This Holy Church can declare, that theſe plain words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> do declare it, and to avoid further miſtake, may give a new clearer Name to the old Myſtery ſo revealed by Chriſt, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51079:10"/> Preached by the Apoſtles, calling it <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> as She calls the Myſtery of God, one in Nature, and three in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Holy <hi>Trinity,</hi> a Name not found in Scripture, which ſo diſpleaſed the <hi>Arians</hi> heretofore, and <hi>Calvin</hi> of late; not by making any new Article of Faith, but more clearly delivering what was ever believed by the Apoſtles, and all Catholics from their time to this: ſo that ſtill we own <hi>Sanctae Scripturae ſufficienter Continent omnem ſcientiam Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi>

            <p>The infallibility of the Church being thus Expounded, and ſuch is that which Catholics believe, and are guided by; I cannot conceive how any Chriſtian can object any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, who believes that what God revealed muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be true, and that Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I proceed then to prove that God hath revealed the Catholic Church ſhould ever be guided by his holy Spirit, and ever follow that Guide, and never fall into any Error in Faith, and to do it moſt convincingly againſt all Sectaries, I will prove it by the Texts of Holy Scripture, ſuch as their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bible offers, and this not by two or three, which would ſuffice, but by a number, and that I may not ſeem to give my own ſenſe to thoſe Texts, I will join to them the Expoſition of the Holy Fathers, given in all Ages, according to the ſenſe of the Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>By the Catholic Church I mean not only the Church of all Ages, but the whole Church of any Ages, and conſequently
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51079:11"/> the Catholic Church of this Age, for it is the ſame Church, there being but <hi>One,</hi> as all our Creed teaches us. I ſay as the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>yield a full belief to God, and his Servant Moyſes;</hi> to God as the author of their Faith, and to <hi>Moyſes</hi> as the<note place="margin">

            <p>That this Church is an infallible Witneſs to all that Chriſt did teach, is evident from the Commands laid upon us by the Prophets, by Chriſt our Lord, by the Apoſtles, to receive with an entire ſubmiſſion all that it delivers, for it is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Gods infinite Veracity, that he ſhould oblige us to believe an Error.

               <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſeldom ſupports her ſelf without <hi>Blaſphemy;</hi> we have both here in ſtore. As for his firſt Obſervation, I underſtand not the meaning of it, the Text hinted at being this, <hi>There ſhall be time when they will not bear ſound Doctrin, but according to their own deſires they will heap to themſelves Maſters, having itching Ears.</hi> I blamed not the Hearers, but the Teacher; and in this particular Caſe I am very well ſatisfied, that the witty and Learned Gentlemen of the <hi>Temple,</hi> are ſo far from hearing this Doctrin of Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> with itching Ears, that they pity his Ignorance, and blame his forwardneſs, and bluſh at ſo weak and ill-knit a piece of Sophiſtry; and therefore I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmit what I write in this Engagement, to their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. As to the <hi>Queſtion</hi> he asks me, his ignorance of our Belief prompts it to him: For we believe our Church Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible by the Infallibility of <hi>Chriſt</hi> who remains with her, and of the Holy Ghoſt who guides her into all Truths: And for this we bring the ſame Proofs, to wit, Prophecies, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Preaching it, and his Miracles Confirming it, beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual viſible Event of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Prophecies concerning his Church. This <hi>Queſtion</hi> then is very ſilly.</p>
            <p>But his two Proofs are in another Strain; by the Firſt he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51079:15"/> intimates, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> could not have challeng'd an <hi>Implicit Faith</hi> reaſonably from the <hi>Jews:</hi> A Poſition which, <hi>to the ſhame of Chriſtianity,</hi> this laſt Age and pretended <hi>Reformation</hi> hath often offered and ſupported: Contrary to <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s own Sacred words, who often urged the <hi>Jews</hi> to believe his words on the account of his miraculous <hi>Works,</hi> by which if he had not proved the truth of his words, he owned that <hi>they had not had ſin.</hi> The Matter is finely mended, and Chriſtianity is brought by theſe Men to a fair paſs, when <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s words are not to be believed by <hi>an Implicit Faith.</hi> The Church of God, tho' Infallible, ſends as much to the Scriptures as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did, ſince that ſhe offers each Point of the Faith ſhe teaches, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered immediately or mediately in the Holy Scriptures. The Prophecies of himſelf which <hi>Chriſt</hi> cited, were indeed to be ſought and found in the Scriptures; but 'tis a pleaſant Fancy to apply thoſe words, <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> to all that <hi>Chriſt</hi> did teach; as if the Goſpels, and whatever <hi>Chriſt</hi> did Preach, contained no <hi>new Revelations,</hi> nothing but what could be found in the <hi>ancient Teſtament.</hi> A great ſtock of Patience is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to anſwer calmly ſuch Impertinencies as are brought to ſupport the Errors with which theſe late Hereſies are patch'd up. But the laſt Defence brought for Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> is ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, and I could well quarrel with you, Sir, (as a Chriſtian) for Licenſing it. What, do you own that <hi>we only</hi> are to look on the Faith even as Preached by <hi>Chriſt, as neceſſarily Infallible?</hi> Is it no part of <hi>your</hi> Belief that you are any way concerned in, that <hi>that certain Faith which</hi> Chriſt <hi>exacted from the</hi> Jews, <hi>St.</hi> Paul <hi>from each Chriſtian,</hi> muſt of neceſſity be Infallible?</p>

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Do I renounce my Reaſon, when I embrace what my Reaſon hath convinced me to be <hi>infallibly true?</hi> Sure, Sir, you have too much Senſe, not to own this to be a ſenſleſs Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. But let us apply it to another Caſe. When a <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> is convinced, and that, if you pleaſe, infallibly, that <hi>the Word of God in the Bible delivers a Truth,</hi> and his Reaſon hath convinced him of it, is he not to abandon whatever Reaſon can object againſt the Myſtery? If you ſay he is not, then a Man <hi>may doubt of the truth of Gods Word.</hi> A very Chriſtian <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Principle! If you ſay he is, then 'tis not ſevere, but moſt reaſonable, to renounce Reaſon when it oppoſes it ſelf to a Truth infallibly Preached, and received from an Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity acknowledged Infallible. As for the three Texts, I have before ſhewed how the <hi>Firſt</hi> is wreſted from its plain natural Senſe to the oppoſite. The <hi>Third</hi> is againſt him; for the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans received</hi> (Firſt) <hi>the Word with all readineſs of mind, and</hi> (then) <hi>ſearched the Scriptures,</hi> to ſee in them thoſe Texts which the Apoſtles uſed to convince the ſtubborn, and ſo do Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51079:16"/> The <hi>Second</hi> is neither directly nor indirectly to the purpoſe: For St. <hi>Paul</hi> having brought a <hi>Reaſon</hi> why they were to abſtain from ſuch Meat and Drink as was offered to Idols, to wit, that ſince they did partake of the true Sacrifice of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Body and Blood, they could no more uſe what was Sacrificed to Idols, than ſerve at two oppoſite Altars, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the true God and the falſe ones, he asks them, Whether <hi>this Reaſon is not convincing?</hi> Now I would know whether a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge (much more an infallible one) doth diſclaim his own Power, becauſe he offers evident Reaſons for the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence he gives, and ſhews the Parties obſtinacy, that ſhould refuſe to ſubmit to them? As for thoſe words, <hi>As to wiſe Men I ſpeak,</hi> the honeſt Footman little underſtands the meaning of them; it being the Language of the Primitive Church, when any thing was touched concerning the great Sacrament of our Bleſſed Lord's Body and Blood, not to publiſh that high Myſtery, but to refer to the private Inſtruction about it, which was given after Baptiſm, and never truſted to the Catechumens: an evident Proof, that in this Sacrament there was a high Myſtery beyond the Faith in Chriſt our Redeemer, as Saviour of the World, and Food of our Souls by his Paſſion, without which no one was admitted to Baptiſm. Thus St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> ever expreſſed himſelf in this Subject: <hi>The</hi>

You are Judges in your own Caſe (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout infallibility)—We have the concurrent teſtimony of all Churches, that we have thoſe Canonical Books.—But let us ſuppoſe a while, that your Church were infallible, what greater certainty (<hi>for that is the point you know which the Doctor was upon</hi>) have you of it, than we have of any particular Point of Faith? as for the certainty of Reaſon and Argument, That we have, and would fain ſee you ſhew more.

Pray Sir review this laſt Diſcourſe, bluſh that your Licenſe Authoriſes it, and hereafter have ſome care of your Reputation, and ſet not your Name to ſuch Stuff. This is the Caſe: on one ſide, there is ſuppoſed an Infallible Interpreter of the Chriſtians great Law-Book; (for thus Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſtates the Caſe) on the other are ſome men, (far the greater part unlearned and weak) who allow not any ſenſe to this Book, which ſeems to them <hi>to Contradict either (their) Senſe or Reaſon, or any other Principle of (their) Knowledge.</hi> And I am asked whether I proceed more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51079:17"/> in receiving the ſenſe of the Law from that Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (which is actually ſuppoſed infallible) or in proceeding by the ſecond method. Sir, if you are ſo weak or wilful, as not to declare that I have a greater certainty in ſubmitting to that infallible Interpreter, your Counſel is not worth the asking, and I appeal to that of the judicious Gentlemen of the <hi>Temple.</hi> But I muſt not omit the untruth couched in thoſe words, <hi>We have the Concurrent Teſtimony of all Churches, that we have thoſe Canonical Books;</hi> For no part of the <hi>Catholic</hi> Church, no part of the <hi>Greek Sciſmatic</hi> Churches, own the ſame Canon of Scripture-Books which you do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſervative,</hi> Ibid. <hi>In particular we are aſſured that the Faith which we profeſs is agreeable to Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer, fol.</hi> 5. If he means they have the ſame Proofs for this, which Catholics have for the infallibility of the Church, that is, for the Continued Being of that Church, which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us that She is infallible in directing us, (for a Church Erring in ſo Fundamental a Point, would ceaſe to be the Church of Chriſt) then, it is evidently faſe, ſince each Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian in this Age, hath the ſame Evidence of Her being the Church of Chriſt, and of Her teaching all Truth, and conſequently of Her being (as She declares) infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in thus teaching, which he hath of Chriſt, to wit, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Propheſies, thoſe of Chriſt himſelf; his Miracles, and the Miracles wrought in that Church, according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt, beſides the Converſion of Nations to Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, as Proofs of their particular Senſe in Interpreting Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Defence, fol.</hi> 10. This is a pretty Conceit, the <hi>infallibility of the Church,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the Being of the Church;</hi> can't a Church be without being infallible.—We have heard much of Miracles, but could never ſee any.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Do you allow ſuch Anſwers Sir, that have ſo little of Senſe and leſs of Piety? Can a Church remain the Church of Chriſt, and yet teach her ſelf to be infallibly gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Spirit of Chriſt, whil'ſt ſhe is abandon'd to the Spirit of Error, and that ſo far as Idolatry, and the Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Paſſion of Chriſt? Are we come to own that
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51079:17"/> 
               <hi>Herod</hi> might well be excuſed from believing in Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he had heard much of his Miracles, but could never ſee any?</hi> Well Sir, when you Licenſe ſuch an other Diſcourſe, add to your Titles that of <hi>a Chriſtian,</hi> that we may think you are one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſervative,</hi> fol. 23. <hi>If you muſt not uſe your Reaſon and private judgment, then you muſt not by any Reaſons be perſuaded to condemn the uſe of Reaſon.</hi>

               <hi>Anſw. f.</hi> 5. I never heard ſo much, and ſo little of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.—All he ſays, might with equal weight be ſaid by a ſick Man, who diſſuaded from chooſing his own Remedies, and deſired to ſend for a skilful Doctor, ſhould anſwer, '<hi>Tis impoſſible by Reaſon to perſuade me not to uſe my Reaſon, in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning my ſelf by Reaſon as my own Reaſon teaches me, which would be to Condemn Reaſon, and yet be guided by your Reaſon, or the Doctor's Reaſon.</hi> Such a Diſcourſe would prove the Sick party at leaſt ſomewhat light-headed: What 'tis a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom of in Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> I will not be poſitive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Defence, f.</hi> 11. Is this Sick Man perſuaded to renounce his Reaſon, or rather is it not that he ſhould ſubmit his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (not renounce his Reaſon) in that caſe to that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom he hath all the reaſon in the world to believe hath better knowledge, and underſtanding of thoſe things which are to be uſed for his recovery than himſelf? And all this while methinks he is governed by Reaſon, though he doth not think fit to truſt his own skill.—But this bears no compariſon, Religion is, or ought to be the Concern of all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The <hi>Footman</hi> prevaricates here, or is aſhamed of his Maſter's groſs Sophiſtry, and will not ſtand by it. 'Tis Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> who pretends that a Catholic by following an infallible Guide <hi>renounces his Reaſon;</hi> I contend that all the while <hi>he is governed by Reaſon,</hi> and chiefly, becauſe that in a matter of that Concern, <hi>he thinks not fit to truſt his own skill:</hi> which God hath as often declared to be too weak in any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſon, as he hath declared he would give to all, ſuch Paſtors and Teachers as ſhould guide them, and Commanded each to repair to them, to be guided by them. But Religion is or <hi>ought to be the Concern of all,</hi> a wiſe Obſervation!. So is, or ought to be each ones health, and the preſervation of his
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51079:18"/> life: as therefore each one ought to adviſe with a good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor concerning his Health, a good Lawyer for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Fortune; ſo, and much more with a good Guide, and (ſince it can be had) an infallible one, for the ſecuring of his Souls eternal happineſs: the Practice of Religion is the duty of all; but the teaching it, of thoſe Doctors whom God hath appointed to that end, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches us <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. is not this Sir, a moſt evident truth?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Preſervative,</hi> f. 25. <hi>Thou ſhalt Worſhip the Lord thy God, and him only ſhalt thou ſerve;</hi> is ſuch a plain and expreſs Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that no reaſon can juſtifie the Worſhip of another Being.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. f.</hi> 6. A rare Conſequence! to Infer a Negative for an Affirmative Antecedent, that bears no oppoſition with it. 'Tis like this, <hi>a Subject muſt love his King, and pay Allegiance to him alone;</hi> therefore no Reaſon can juſtifie the love of a Man for his Wife, or of a Child for his Father. St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> drew from that very Text the contrary Concluſion, he takes off all blame from <hi>Abraham,</hi> who is ſaid in <hi>Geneſis</hi> to<note place="margin">Q. 61. in <hi>Gen.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Defence,</hi> f. 12. <hi>What a delicate piece of Sophiſtry is here? The Commandment is to ſerve God only,</hi> which ſervice we muſt of neceſſity underſtand to be that which is Divine, but Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is ſo.—Therefore the Text is plain againſt the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of any other but God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> All that is plain in this Anſwer is, that men neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily want a Guide in the interpreting of Scripture, and that an infallible one alſo, for ſuch is the pride of ſome men, that even an ignorant <hi>Foot-man</hi> (as you ſee) thinks he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the Bible better than the Holieſt and moſt Learned of Doctors S. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and what reaſon teaches of the Service of God better than the moſt enlightened Patriarchs. <hi>Abraham</hi> Worſhips men: S. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> declares that the Commandment hath nothing againſt it, there being an inferior Worſhip, which is far below Divine Service: but the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51079:18"/> teaches his <hi>Footman</hi> to aver, that <hi>all Worſhip</hi> (ſo he ſhould have ſaid to have ſpoken ſenſe) <hi>is Divine,</hi> that the Text is plain againſt the Worſhip of any other but God. How likely is it they ſhall by their own judgment and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon underſtand the Bible, who cannot conſtrue right, the Commandments, no, not the firſt of them! and if Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> and his <hi>Footman</hi> underſtand right the firſt Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> did not. Do you not bluſh Sir, to Licenſe the boldneſs of ſuch ignorant Pride?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw. f.</hi> 6. What if you be told that the <hi>Jews</hi> may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have had a Command of making no graven Image, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this being a poſitive Law, and not renewed in the Goſpel, doth not oblige us: will this Reaſon be admitted of? <hi>No, no reaſon;</hi> and yet you have no other reaſon for paſſing by as Expreſs a Law of Sanctifying <hi>Saturday.</hi> What if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd that only the making <hi>to themſelves</hi> (by private Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, making that to be which is not, a Statue for Example, which of its nature is the repreſentation of a Man, or a Calf, to be to them a true God) an <hi>Idol to adore it,</hi> which divine Worſhip thus miſapplyed is forbidden.

'Tis ſufficient (with Catholics) to ſubmit to an infallible Guide, <hi>and</hi> that too if he declares as the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> did <hi>Concerning the Euchariſt, that notwithſtanding our Lord did Inſtitute it in both kinds, and the Apoſtles ſo celebrated it, yet now it ſhould not be ſo.</hi> But for us <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> we cannot think that any Reaſon can be ſufficient to lay aſide an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Text.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The meaning of theſe words as they lay here, is to perſuade the Readers, that the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> did own that Chriſt did Inſtitute or order, that the Sacrament ſhould be taken by all in both kinds, and that in the Apoſtles time it was ever ſo taken: yet that by the Church Authority it was ordered it ſhould hereafter be otherwiſe: If the Honeſt <hi>Footman</hi> means not ſo, and would not have all to believe ſo,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51079:19"/> there is no ſenſe at all in this his Inference, <hi>That</hi> Proteſtants <hi>cannot think that any reaſon can be ſufficient to lay aſide an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Text.</hi> But in this ſenſe 'tis <hi>a moſt outragious Calumny,</hi> and though a <hi>Footman</hi>'s ignorance may be excuſed, yet with what face Sir, can you pretend to judge of Books and Licenſe them, if you are in the ſame groſs Error; or if wilfully and wittingly you Licenſe ſuch impudent Slanders, againſt the whole Churches Repreſentative, what Libels, and Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poons, are you not qualified and diſpoſed to Licenſe? Theſe<note place="margin">Decreta Concil Conſ.

               <hi>received by the Faithful not faſting, but in caſe of ſickneſs, and ſuch other neceſſity, as the Canon Law and the Church admit, or allow of. And ſo this Cuſtom, to avoid ſome dangers and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, hath been reaſonably brought in; that, although this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Primitive Church was received by the Faithful under both kinds, ſince that it ſhould be received by thoſe who Conſecrate (Prieſts) in both kinds, by the Laity only under the appearance of Bread. Becauſe we are firmly to believe, and in no way to doubt, that the entire Body and Blood of Chriſt is truly contained as well under the ſpecies of Bread, as under that of Wine.</hi> Behold the Council declares, that it owns it no part of the Inſtitution, that the Sacrament be taken under both kinds, no more than that it be taken at Night after Supper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe being but Circumſtances belonging to that Diſcipline, which whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depends on Church Authority, and is alterable at any time when there is reaſon for it.

But if you would have me conclude from theſe Premiſſes.</hi> Ergo, <hi>there is an infallible Judge of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, I muſt beg your pardon for that, for ſuch Arguments as theſe do not prove that there is ſuch a Judge, but only, that there ought to be one, and therefore I muſt Conclude no more from them. Indeed, this is a very fallacious way of Reaſoning, becauſe what we may call uſeful, convenient, neceſſary, may not be ſo it ſelf: and we have reaſon to believe it is not ſo, if God have not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what we think ſo uſeful, convenient, and neceſſary,</hi> &amp;c.

Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſays well in adviſing us to believe that not to be neceſſary, which we know God hath not appointed, therefore I did not touch, or reflect on that ſaying: but I ſay that the advice he gives to one <hi>who
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:51079:20"/> ſuppoſes there</hi> is a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of any thing towards the Eternal Salvation of Chriſtians, <hi>That tho' he believe it true, yet he infers not,</hi> Sure then God hath beſtowed it, Chriſt hath obtained it for us; but rather, <hi>God ought to have done it, Chriſt ought to have obtained it; but I do not therefore believe he hath.</hi> This Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I ſay, is much more injurious to Gods Mercy and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, than the Saying ſo much blamed by all Chriſtians in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſus;</hi> the Salvation of Mankind being the ultimate Work of God towards his own Glory. Whether this Charge be not juſt, and Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> teach not this Doctrin in the words cited by the Anſwerer, in the Caſe of one who <hi>ſuppoſes that there can be no certain Faith in a Chriſtian,</hi> (and ſuch a Faith Chriſt exacts in all, by St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>without an infallible Guide, and who believes it to be true;</hi> I leave it, Sir, to your obſervation.</p>

Now the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, by what Method we ought to come to that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as far as it is neceſſary to a Chriſtian: and I ſay that all the Methods are reduced to theſe two Heads: That we are guided to the certain knowledge of what God hath revealed, either by a Knowledge communicated to each of us, or by a Knowledge communicated only to Guides apppointed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the reſt. If therefore <hi>Proteſtants</hi> are in the wrong, we are certainly in the right, as far as we are oppoſite to them. And beſides, ſince that all the poſitive Proofs that can be brought for the infallible Authority of Church-Teachers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs alſo in what Church they are, by evident Marks not to be found but in our <hi>Catholic</hi> Church, it follows, if the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> be in the wrong as to that Principle, we are certainly in the right as to each Point of our Religion, taught us by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Interpreter.</p>

Beſides the two mention'd, it fignfies a <hi>Third thing</hi> alſo, to wit, That whatever Reaſons there may be for a thing, he who believes it, hath not for the Motive of his Belief thoſe certain Reaſons. There are, for Example, <hi>certain Reaſons,</hi> whereon to ground a Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> yet he that believes in Chriſt <hi>meerly becauſe his Mother</hi> (or a Miniſter) <hi>hath taught him ſo to do,</hi> hath a very <hi>uncertain,</hi> and no <hi>Divine Faith.</hi>

                  <hi>Defence f.</hi> 18. What can be the Gentleman's meaning, I cannot conceive, unleſs it be this, That becauſe <hi>Proteſtants</hi> take the Reaſon of their Faith from Scripture, and not from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that therefore they can have no certain or Divine Faith: which if it be, I pity him; if it be not, I muſt deſire him to explain himſelf.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The honeſt Footman is grown very tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But is not this very plain, that altho' there be very good Reaſons for the belief of an Article of Chriſtian Religion, yet one that ſhould believe it on the account of ſome ſilly Motive only, ſuch as I cited, would have no Divine Faith? But how can this be applied to <hi>Proteſtants, who take the Reaſons of their Faith from Scripture?</hi> This I had ſhewed <hi>Fol.</hi> 6. but the <hi>Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> paſſes it by with this Anſwer only, <hi>I ſhall ſay nothing to that Harangue, ſo often Anſwered by our Divines.</hi> It ſeems he had forgot thoſe Anſwers, or was conſcious of their weakneſs. Thus I diſcourſed there: The <hi>Catholics</hi> prove, that an <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> or wavering Faith, is <hi>no Divine Faith,</hi> which the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> can never have of any one Article of their Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they never can have a certain one. 'Tis eaſily proved, becauſe they cannot have an act of Faith of any one Article, till their Rule of Faith propoſes it, <hi>i. e.</hi> till they know cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly (by their private Reading and Judgment) what the Scriptures teach of it, not by ſome one Text or two, but by comparing all the Texts that treat of that Subject: for the Senſe of a ſingle Text (for Examp. <hi>My Father is greater than I</hi>) cannot be had, but by expounding it by other Texts on the ſame Subject. Till a <hi>Proteſtant then</hi> hath a certain knowledge, <hi>Firſt,</hi> that he hath all the Books of Holy Writ; <hi>Secondly,</hi> that all thoſe he owns for ſuch, were really written by inſpired Pens; <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that he hath a true and ſound Tranſlation (in caſe he underſtood not the Original Languages) and (in caſe he doth) a true Copy not altered by the Error or Malice of our Forefathers; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> (ſince the Letter kills) that he underſtands the true Meaning and Senſe of each Text, which relates to the Object of his Act of Faith? <hi>Fifthly,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them all, ſo as comparing them, to ſee which be the <hi>clearer</hi> that muſt expound the <hi>obſcurer,</hi> and what is the <hi>true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult</hi> of them all, (for any one which he underſtands not, or hath forgotten, may poſſibly be that one that muſt expound the reſt) he cannot have <hi>one</hi> Act of Faith. Now <hi>Catholics</hi> ſay, this is impoſſible to moſt, if not to all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> (who are in each of theſe Points to Judge for themſelves, and not to ſubmit to any Authority where a Doubt ariſes) therefore <hi>few,</hi> or <hi>no Proteſtants</hi> can in their whole Life-time frame one Act of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51079:22"/> Faith</hi> concerning any <hi>one Myſtery,</hi> not that Scripture is not a very certain Rule, but becauſe they have choſen an uſeleſs (becauſe impoſſible) and <hi>uncertain</hi> way of applying it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preſervat. ib.</hi> We believe the Apoſtles Creed, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contained in the Writings of the Evangeliſts and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. This is all we believe, and I hope they will not ſay theſe things are uncertain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> They are very certain, but not to any <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> whoſe Rule of Faith (conſidering the Method he applies it by) cannot make him certain of any one Article. But the pleaſant Anſwer which Juſtifies <hi>Turk, Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile:</hi> For this is a Rule of Faith moſt ſufficient, according to Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> (and a good Plea) <hi>We believe all that God hath revealed, and nothing elſe, is not all that he hath revealed certain?</hi> Here lies the Doctor's groſs Miſtake, that no one is an <hi>Heretic</hi> for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that what God hath revealed is true, 'tis impoſſible to fall into ſo mad an Hereſie: But <hi>Heretics</hi> are ſuch, for not believing him to have revealed what in effect he hath, tho' he hath given ſufficient Methods to come to the knowledge of it, if they would uſe them.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> No, Sir, nor you neither. If they believed all that God hath revealed, (as they pretend) they would believe all that is delivered in the Bible, which you pretend, but upon as little ground: What they think in their Judgment God hath revealed, they believe; what they think he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, they disbelieve: that's their Rule of Faith, and 'tis yours, your own private Judgments being on both hands your Guides, and not any Authority Eſtabliſhed by Almighty God.</p>

                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Even this is moſt notoriouſly falſe, ſince ſhe is not Infallible by any Light of her own, but by the Guidance of the Spirit of Truth. Were not the Apoſtles, when they had once acknowledged <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be the Son of God, certain

                  <hi>Defence f.</hi> 19, 20. Here the honeſt <hi>Footman</hi> ſends me for an Anſwer to Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and bids me try my Skill upon him. Thus he delivers the Anſwer given to <hi>J. S.</hi> firſt Letter, and applied to the preſent Caſe; 'tis divided into five Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which, to avoid repeating, I'll ſet down with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Anſwer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Arithmetick</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet) preſcribes a certain way by Addition and Subſtraction, to find out any Sum.</hi> 'Tis granted. Secondly, <hi>Therefore it muſt be ſuch, that they who take it, ſhall arrive by it at the exact Sum.</hi> Thats true alſo. Thirdly, <hi>But two Men, who have made uſe of the ſame, way, differ at leaſt a Hundred in caſting up the Sum.</hi> This is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, if they both really made uſe of that way as the words of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> expreſs: But 'tis very poſſible, if the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be, one of them doth not know the Rules of Arithmetick, but only thinks he knows them; or both know well the Rule, but one blundered, and ſet down one Figure for another.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51079:23"/> Fourthly, <hi>Therefore they who take only that way, cannot by it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the certain Sum.</hi> This is evidently falſe, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary true; to wit, <hi>Therefore they who take preciſely that way,</hi> (and not another for it, erring in the Theory or the Practice) <hi>cannot but arrive by it at the certain Sum.</hi> But this following Concluſion might have been drawn from the Third Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taken in its Second <hi>moſt improper Senſe,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Stilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet</hi> gives to it, <hi>Therefore thoſe who err in the Knowledge, or miſs in the Application of the Rule of Arithmetick, tho' they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve never ſo much in their own Judgment that they know and uſe the Rule right, tho' they have uſed their beſt Endeavors, tho' they firmly believe they have caſt the Sum right, yet certainly they have miſſed, and are in the wrong.</hi> This is the Concluſion which the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> ſhould have drawn, and then he might have concluded, <hi>Still the Rule is certain to thoſe who uſe it right.</hi> But is this the <hi>Reverend Dr. Stillingfleet's full Anſwer,</hi> and that in Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Caſe? Stupidity it ſelf would not own it: Tis an evident Demonſtration againſt Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Poſition, and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Tenet. It proves evidently, that altho' Scripture be as infallible a Truth, and thereby <hi>a Rule of Truth,</hi> (for from Truth only Truth can follow) as any Rule of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick;<note place="margin">Ex vero non niſi verum.</note> yet as in one Caſe, if two caſting up an Account by the ſame pretended Rule, differ in the total Sum, this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle would not only be falſe, but alſo after ſuch a trial moſt abſurd and ſenſleſs. <hi>Every one is bound in reaſon to believe the Account he hath caſt up, to be right, if he hath a Book of Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick by him, hath read it, believes he underſtands it, and hath uſed his beſt Endeavors to follow it.</hi> So is this like Principle, which Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> and all his Party ſtand for: <hi>If two Men have the Bible, read it, endeavor to underſtand it, and believing they do, draw from the ſame Scriptures two different Concluſions, two oppoſite Articles of Faith, both are bound to ſtand to their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgment, and to believe themſelves in the right, tho' all the World ſhould accuſe one or both of them in lieu of the true pretended Rule, to have uſed a falſe one.</hi> But let us ſuppoſe farther, that an eminent Maſter of Arithmetick ſhould ſhew to one of theſe Men where he erred againſt the true Rule of that Science, where he miſplaced a cypher, otherwiſe than the Rule directs; that this Man in lieu of ſubmitting, ſhould appeal to his Book
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51079:23"/> of Arithmetick, by the which alſo the other teaches, and the Diſpute ſhould be carried on by the one ſaying the Book teaches and directs thus, whilſt the other as ſturdily pretended it teaches and directs otherwiſe. In this Caſe were it a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Principle, <hi>Both muſt ſtand to their private Judgment in Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting of the Book, and well they may, for the Rule is certain, which both follow.</hi> Never did Man give a fairer and eaſier Victory to an Adverſary, than Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> doth to his, by this <hi>Simile.</hi> The dulleſt School-Boy will eaſily diſcern the Dean of <hi>Paul</hi>'s patent <hi>Parallogiſm,</hi> whereby he compares the <hi>written Word</hi> of God to the Rule it ſelf of Arithmetick; whereas the natural and only true Compariſon is, of the <hi>Book or Letter of Scripture</hi> with the Book of Arthmetick; the true Senſe of Scripture with the Rule of Arithmetick.</p>
               <p>A Right-Line-Rule and a <hi>Square</hi> are <hi>the Rule</hi> of a Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſuppoſe a Carpenter had a bent and crooked Rule, and that what he calls his <hi>Square</hi> opened at an <hi>acute</hi> or <hi>obtuſe</hi> Angle; this Man working by theſe, would certainly make his Work wrong. I ask you now where the Fault would be? Certainly in <hi>his Rule,</hi> in his (ſuppoſed) <hi>Square and Rule.</hi> But is not a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter's Rule exact? Yes, <hi>a Carpenter's,</hi> but not <hi>this Carpenter's;</hi> the Rule he pretends to follow is moſt Juſt, <hi>the Rule</hi> which he actually follows is moſt falſe and erroneous: And if many Carpenters pretending to work by a Right-Line and Square, applying them the ſame way, did all differ in the Irregularity of their Work, it would be evident they had a <hi>falſe Rule;</hi> for that's ones <hi>Rule,</hi> not that he <hi>pretends to have,</hi> but what he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally works by. Now to apply this to our Caſe: The <hi>Word of God</hi> is not the Letter, but the true Senſe of the Bible; for the knowledge of Scripture, as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> obſerves, <hi>conſiſts not</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Scripturae non in legendo ſed intelligendo conſiſtant.</note> 
                  <hi>in the Reading, but the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of it.</hi> The Rule of Faith then, is the Senſe of the Letter of Scripture; The <hi>pretended Rule</hi> is the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of Scripture; The real Rule that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans uſe, is that Senſe of the Letter of Scripture by which they ſquare their Faith: for that is any ones real Rule, by which he in reality acts. The true Senſe of Scripture is a <hi>certain Rule;</hi> The Senſe given to the Letter of Scripture is a moſt uncertain, and frequently a wrong Rule; The Rule Proteſtants <hi>pretend</hi> unto, is a certain infallible Rule, for <hi>Truth</hi> never miſguides:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51079:24"/> But <hi>their Rule</hi> of Faith is the Senſe which each Man's private Judgment gives to the Letter of Scripture; for they ſquare their Faith by it, &amp; believe according to the ſame: The Letter of Scripture is their Material Rule, as a piece of Wood is the Material <hi>Square</hi> of a Carpenter; their <hi>application of Senſe to this Letter</hi> is that which makes their real and Formal Rule, as the ſtreightneſs or crookedneſs of a Rule, is the <hi>true Rule</hi> of the Carpenter that uſes it. 'Tis againſt this I write, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Principle, that tho' ſeveral Men uſing the ſame Method of making Rules, find and own that their ſeveral Rules make different Lines; yet it follows not (ſays he) that the Rules they work by are not <hi>true,</hi> nor their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of making themſelves a Rule, erroneous.</p>

If they be, (for Example, out of Spite) tho' their Refuſal be juſt and good, their Motive or Rule they act by (and of that only I ſpeak) is ſtark naught.</p>

               <p>It is when a mans Exterior Actions are naturally capable of a good and pious meaning, and he ever and clearly declares that it is <hi>His.</hi> Yet to faſten upon him another oppoſite deſign and meaning, taken from his oppoſers contrary Principle. Than which there cannot be a greater and more unjuſt <hi>diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity,</hi> this he calls to <hi>join</hi> Proteſtant <hi>Principles with</hi> Popiſh <hi>Practices.</hi> For Example, to inſinuate, <hi>That a Catholick thinks the bleſſed Virgin more Powerful in Heaven than Chriſt;</hi> He tells us, that he ſays ten <hi>Ave Maria's</hi> for <hi>one Lords Prayer.</hi> And this though he knows, that the firſt half of the <hi>Ave Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> is in memory of, and thankſgiving for the Incarnation of Chriſt, and the other half asks of the Virgin, <hi>only to pray for us</hi> to Chriſt, which is all the Power we allow her in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Defence, p.</hi> 24. The matter of Fact is true.—Suppoſe he doth not think her more powerful than Chriſt, yet ſure he muſt think her more merciful, and ready to hear his Prayers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is in lieu of excuſing his Maſters Malice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſingenuity, meerly to make the Proverb Good, <hi>like Maſter, like Man. Mary</hi> her ſelf, her Merciful concern for us, her Prayers are an Effect and Gift of the Mercy of Chriſt. But to ſee how people will ſpeak in ſpight of Senſe, when they are reſolved to impugn Truth: how can it prove that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a perſon more merciful than another, becauſe I repeat oftner my inſtances and Petition. Naturally we call that a greater mercy which is ſooner moved, and yields to a ſingle addreſs. But the whole is a moſt falſe Calumny, as it inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates that our Church applies her Devotions more to our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lady than to Chriſt. Our <hi>Maſs,</hi> our <hi>Church Office,</hi> (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept now and then a ſhort Prayer of three or four lines) our Meditations, our Faſts, are all directed to God and Chriſt, from him only we expect the whole Mercy that muſt blot out our Sins, and the whole Goodneſs that muſt make us Eternally happy.</p>

                  <hi>Anſw. f.</hi> 8. This I call the moſt diſingenuous Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the moſt falſe Calumny imaginable, as a ſuppoſed and owned Truth; to wit, <hi>That</hi> Catholics <hi>Worſhip the viſible Species in the Euchariſt.</hi> A moſt impudent ſlander, no Catholic being guilty of it, no more than the Apoſtles of Worſhiping and Adoring the Cloths of Chriſt, when they Adored him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Defence, f.</hi> 21. There is no mention made of Species, but the word is Sacrament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is what I called diſingenuity. If he takes not Sacrament in the Catholic ſenſe, therein lies his fraud, in Expounding by his oppoſite Principles, our Actions: and in the Catholic ſenſe nothing hath a reference to his Accuſation of a <hi>Breaden God,</hi> but the viſible Species of Bread.</p>
               <p>I concluded with this addreſs to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in Dr. <hi>Sher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks</hi> words, putting (as I owned) the word <hi>Scripture</hi> in the lieu of <hi>Fathers,</hi> to ſhew that according to his very way of Reaſoning, the meer reading of Scripture, could not ſerve for an uſeful Guide at leaſt to the far greateſt part of <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants.</hi> The Sentence is, as follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Preſervative,</hi> f. 76. <hi>Amongſt Chriſtians there is not one in a hundred thouſand who underſtands all Scripture, and it is morally impoſſible they ſhould, and therefore there muſt be certainly an eaſier and ſhorter way to underſtand Chriſtian Religion, than this, or elſe the generality of mankind, even of profeſs'd Chriſtians, are out of poſſibility of Salvation.</hi> Think well on it, as you will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer at Gods Tribunal for the care you took of <hi>the one only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,</hi> the ſaving of your Souls, ſeek out that eaſier and ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way, and walk faithfully in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Defence, f.</hi> 26, 27. We do not only ſay, but we find, that Scripture in all points neceſſary to Salvation, is plain and eaſie, ſo that we may run and read. 'Tis true, there are ſome Texts which we that are unlearned, cannot readily find the true ſenſe and meaning of, but they are not ſuch as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly concern Salvation; and we are not deſtitute of helps as to theſe, for we have learned and Religious Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Is it not pleaſant to ſay, that Scripture is plain and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in all points neceſſary to Salvation: and yet to ſee that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51079:26"/> thoſe who uſe the ſame Method for the underſtanding of it, differ as much as may be in the belief of theſe Points? Is it not againſt plain Scripture, to ſay, that ſuch Texts as the <hi>unlearned</hi> cannot readily find the ſenſe of, are not ſuch as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern Salvation, whereas Scripture teaches us, that there be Texts <hi>which the unlearned wreſt to their own perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Well, I am weary in following this <hi>Footman,</hi> running Extravagantly out of all Way, and Reaſon.

               <p>THO' the <hi>Preface</hi> to Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s <hi>Defence</hi> might very naturally have challenged to be firſt Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet becauſe the <hi>Defence</hi> did attempt (tho' moſt vainly) to undermine the very Foundation of the Chriſtian Faith, that <hi>Rock</hi> of the <hi>Catholic Church,</hi> on which <hi>Chriſt</hi> our Bleſſed Lord raiſed it; whereas the <hi>Preface</hi> was ſtuffed chiefly with forged Calumnies againſt me, I thought it my Duty (and ever ſhall) to paſs by my own private Concerns, till I had vindicated the Church of God. Now, Sir, I come to my own Defence.</p>
               <p>I find my Adverſaries Choler heated to the higheſt Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe I Anſwered the <hi>Celebrated Preſervative,</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Tract, ſays he, proved <hi>ſo acceptable by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Entertainment it met with,</hi> in <hi>a ſingle Sheet,</hi> which he ſays was a ridiculous Anſwer to ſo great a Book. I omitted nothing, Sir, that even pretended to the appearance of an Argument; and if your <hi>Celebrated Books</hi> ſwell ſo with words, and prove void of Senſe and Reaſon, am I blameable for it? He ſhould have pointed at ſome pretended Proofs which I ſlighted to expoſe, or have praiſed me for not wearying my Readers with a dull Prolixity: But it ſeems we muſt copy theſe Men's Faults, or abide their Cenſure.</p>
               <p>He tells us next, That <hi>the Accuſations of Forgery, of Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Texts, Fathers and Councils, Run high on both ſides; That the Reader hath this certain way of knowing where the Guilt lies; That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>accuſes us, but do's not prove it; but our Men do not only accuſe them, but prove it upon them.</hi> This is indeed ſomewhat material, and he inſtances upon <hi>my For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries</hi> on the one ſide, and thoſe that Dr. <hi>Comber,</hi> Author of the <hi>Advice to Roman-Catholics,</hi> is accuſed of on the other. I am content to joyn iſſue upon this matter; and having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the Grounds on which theſe ſeveral Accuſations are
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51079:27"/> bottom'd, I will leave the Deciſion to your and every unbiaſſed Reader's Judgment, having firſt owned <hi>Forgery</hi> to be the greateſt Mark of a bad Cauſe, and that even owned ſuch by thoſe who thus defend it. He produces againſt me three Letters, written, as he ſays, <hi>by one of their Learned Writers;</hi> in which no leſs than One and twenty ſuch Forgeries are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon me, and <hi>Proteſtant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> like, becauſe I am <hi>accuſed,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes me <hi>guilty,</hi> without taking the leaſt notice of my full Anſwers given to thoſe moſt falſe Calumnies; he and his <hi>Learned Author</hi> following both the old Advice, <hi>Calumniare fortiter, aliquid adhaerebit;</hi> Do but Calumniate boldly, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will ſtick of the Dirt you caſt. Firſt then, I will ſhew the confident Impudence of my Accuſer.</p>
               <p>I Preached on the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt before his Sacred Majeſty at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> on the Converſion of St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> from Hereſie and a looſe Life; and throughout that Sermon I laid out in the B. Saint's own words, thoſe miſtaken Reaſons that hindred him, and keep off preſent <hi>Sectaries</hi> from a due Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with the Catholic Church: I offered evident Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives taken from the ſame Saint's words, which obliged Him, and do as efficaciouſly exact from all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> under pain of Eternal Damnation, (when a moſt dull Ignorance doth not excuſe them) to return to the Communion of that <hi>one only Church,</hi> which they profeſſed themſelves Members of at their <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Thoſe unanſwerable Arguments of ſo great a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor moved many, to my knowledge, to a happy Imitation of ſo Learned a Saint; but they were too plain and ſolid to meet with even a ſeeming Anſwer from the boldeſt of their Mercenary Pens.</p>
               <p>The only Trick left them, was by ſome ſlie Inſinuation, ſome Calumny, to divert the well-meaning Reader's Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and a Miniſter, better known by his <hi>Forehead</hi> than <hi>Wit,</hi> attempted it boldly in a <hi>Poſtſcript.</hi> He was however afraid of burning his Fingers with touching the <hi>Sermon</hi> it ſelf, but nibled at three Lines of the Introduction to it, a <hi>Form of Prayer to the Bleſſed Virgin Mother of our Lord,</hi> taken out of the <hi>Thirty fifth Sermon</hi> of S. Auguſtin <hi>de Sanctis:</hi> Then to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port himſelf with big words, he accuſes me of <hi>Forgery</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuity,</hi> not for citing any thing otherwiſe than it lay in that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51079:28"/> Sermon, but becauſe, forſooth, this is not really St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Sermon, but a <hi>Spurious Piece</hi> unjuſtly Fathered upon him: Then he as inſolently triumphs, as a weak Enemy, who not daring to attack a Camp, ſhould brag of the Victory, becauſe he had moſt couragiouſly ſhot at random at an expoſed Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel. Now, Sir, take a view of his Proofs, and of thoſe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries he accuſes me of in the two Letters, which I writ in my own Defence. His Proofs were theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> the Title, <hi>A Sermon on the Feaſt of the Aſſumption</hi> doth not agree at all to any thing that is near <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s time. There was then not only no Feaſt of the Aſſumption (therefore no Sermon could then be Preached on that Solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) but not even any belief of ſuch an Aſſumption.</p>
               <p>This is a moſt weak pretence of a Proof: For, as I ſhewed, that <hi>Day of Aſſumption,</hi> when applied to any deceaſed Saint, ever ſignified in the Language of Fathers, <hi>the Day of their Death.</hi> I cited ſeveral Sermons made by the Fathers, as <hi>S. Cyril, Amphilochius, Methodius,</hi> made on our Lady's <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> long before any <hi>Solemnity</hi> of it were obſerved in the Church of God: That <hi>S. Hierom,</hi> or an Author of the ſame Age, <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Paris, S. Bernard,</hi> made Orations on the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> of our Bleſſed Lady, altho' they doubted of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſumed into Heaven in Body: That the Sermon in <hi>S. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liton</hi>'s name, own'd for his in the Fifth Century, ſpake as fully on the real Aſſumption of our Bleſſed Lady, as any <hi>Catholic</hi> ever did ſince. And therefore it is evidently falſe, that there was no ſuch Belief in <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s time. Farther I added, That, as <hi>Nicephorus</hi> witneſſes, <hi>Juvenal</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> proved the truth of this Myſtery as now piouſly believed in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, to have been received of very ancient Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that in the preſence of <hi>Marcion</hi> the Emperor, in whoſe time was the Fourth General Council. Next I ſhew'd what a <hi>Cheat</hi> this Miniſter put upon his Readers, by inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the <hi>Thirty fifth Sermon</hi> I cited, ſpake not of the Bleſſed Virgins <hi>Death,</hi> but of her <hi>Aſſumption</hi> in the Senſe which that word now vulgarly bears; whereas the contrary is moſt evident, and is expreſſed in ſuch words as are found in all the ancient Writings of the Fathers on this Subject; to wit, <hi>In theſe the World is honor'd by ſo great a Virgins departure; in what
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51079:28"/> order or manner ſhe paſſed hence to Heaven, the Catholic Church doth no way recount, neither is her Body found on Earth, neither is her Aſſumption in the Fleſh (as it is read in the Apocrypha's) found in the Catholic Church. This is the true Opinion concerning her Aſſumption, that not knowing whether in her Body or out of it, (as the Apoſtle hath it) we believe her aſſumed above the Angels.</hi> It is not evident from hence, that this Miniſter moſt falſly impoſed upon his Readers? To this Accuſation of mine he returns not a word of Anſwer; to my Proofs, only theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant Trifles, That <hi>Nicephorus</hi> comes too late; That <hi>S. Bernard</hi> doubted of our Bleſſed Lady's Aſſumption in Body; That the firſt mention we find of <hi>Meliton</hi>'s Book was Sixty Years after <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s time, when it was declared Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal: Not a word to the Sermon under <hi>S. Hierom</hi>'s name, nor to any of my other Proofs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Second Proof</hi> was, That very lately ſome <hi>Benedictin</hi>'s at <hi>Paris,</hi> in their late Edition of <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s Works, had caſt it into their <hi>Appendix</hi> as <hi>Spurious;</hi> and that they told us, that in their MSS. it wanted the Name of any Author; but that the <hi>Louvain</hi> Doctors told us, that in ſeveral Manuſcripts which they uſed in their Edition of <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi> this Sermon <hi>de Sanctis</hi> was intitled to <hi>Fulbertus Carnotenſis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. I Anſwered, That theſe were no Proofs, or where they have an appearance of a Proof, that 'tis grounded on a Miſtake. 'Tis no Proof at all on any ſide, that in many Manuſcripts there was <hi>no Name</hi> to the Sermon; this is ſelf-evident. 2. That it is evident this Sermon was not of <hi>Fulbertus Carnotenſis;</hi> for the Sermon I cited aſſures us, that the Church at that time taught nothing of the Corporal Aſſumption of the Virgin; whereas <hi>Fulbertus</hi> in his Sermon of the Nativity of the Bleſſed Virgin, teaches, <hi>That Chriſtian Piety believed, that Chriſt raiſed gloriouſly his Mother, and placed h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r above the Heavens.</hi> This was an undeniable Proof, and therefore the Miniſter anſwers nothing to it: However, I added out of Courteſie, that 'tis no new thing that a Saint's Sermon ſhould in ſome Manuſcripts appear under other Names than their known Authors, the ſame having happened to ſeveral Sermons of <hi>S. Chryſologus, S. Ambroſe, &amp;c.</hi> That <hi>Syncletica</hi>'s Life, the undoubted Work of <hi>S. Athanaſius,</hi> was in ſome ancient Manuſcripts intitled to <hi>Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carp
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51079:29"/> the Anchoret.</hi> The Miniſter diſproves not any one of theſe Inſtances. To his vain Argument, that the Style of this Sermon did ſeem to differ from that of <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s, (which is his private Opinion, and of few late Writers) I oppoſed the contrary Opinion of <hi>S. Thomas Aquinas,</hi> who owned this Sermon to be <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s; that eminent Doctor, ſo well verſed in this Saint's Writings, that he was called <hi>Auguſtinus Contractus:</hi> a Doctor, to the defence of whoſe Doctrin, the greateſt part of Chriſtian Divines are ſworn. Was not this a very full Anſwer? Yet to ſhew how the <hi>Louvain</hi> Doctors owned the <hi>Invocation of Saints</hi> to have been <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, I minded him, that they receive his <hi>Eighteenth</hi> Sermon <hi>de Sanctis,</hi> in which he ſpeaks thus, <hi>Having received theſe our Vows by thy Prayers, obtain Pardon for our Sins.—What we offer, let it by thee be pardonable. What we ask with a faithful Mind, let it become attainable; Receive what we offer, return us what we ask,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Laſt</hi> Proof the Miniſter offers, and which he values moſt, is, That one <hi>Iſidore</hi> is quoted in that <hi>Twenty fifth</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>de Sanctis</hi> thus: <hi>Hence</hi> Iſidore <hi>obſerves it is uncertain by this Saying, whether the Sword of the Spirit is meant, or the Sword of Perſecution.</hi> Now <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil</hi> in his Book of the Life and Death of Saints, Chap. 68. hath theſe words: <hi>Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is uncertain, whether he meant the Sword of Martyrdom, or the Word of God, heavy and ſharp beyond any double-edged Sword.</hi> 'Tis evident, ſays the Miniſter, this ſame <hi>Iſidore</hi> is cited in the <hi>Thirty fifth</hi> Sermon, which could not therefore be of <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>'s compoſing, who lived Two hundred years before this <hi>Iſidore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This indeed hath the face of a Proof; therefore I offered theſe following Reaſons, why the <hi>Iſidore</hi> quoted in the <hi>Thirty fifth</hi> Sermon, was not the <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil.</hi> 1. In the <hi>Thirty fifth</hi> Sermon, in debate, are theſe words: <hi>In our time no Author among the</hi> Latins <hi>can be found, who treating of the Bleſſed Virgins Death, hath been poſitive and expreſs.</hi> Now <hi>S. Gregory of Tours,</hi> being one of the moſt famous Authors of the Sixth Age, and having as fully and poſitively written of this <hi>Aſſumption</hi> as any ſince, the Author aſſuring, that no one amongſt the <hi>Latins</hi> had done ſo, could not be a Learned Biſhop that
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51079:29"/> lived after the Seventh Century; and therefore the <hi>Iſidore</hi> whom he cites, cannot poſſibly be <hi>Iſidore of Sevil.</hi> Again, the Sermon cited under the name of <hi>S. Hierom,</hi> and at leaſt as ancient as the Fourth General Council, and which was cited by the famous <hi>Hincmar</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> by <hi>S. Odilo,</hi> and others contemporaries with <hi>Fulbertus,</hi> could not have eſcaped his knowledge. As for the words of <hi>Iſidore of Sevil,</hi> they vary as much from thoſe that are cited in the <hi>Thirty fifth</hi> Sermon, as the words which expreſs the ſame ſenſe in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who writ before <hi>S. Auguſtin.</hi> Hence I inferr'd, that ſince we know many <hi>Iſidores,</hi> and famous before <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s time, 'tis far more probable, that one of theſe was cited in the <hi>Thirty fifth</hi> Sermon, and therefore without any danger of <hi>Forgery,</hi> I might well cite a Sermon as <hi>S. Auguſtin</hi>'s, (eſpecially in a meer In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to a Sermon) which the greateſt Divine of the latter Ages, and whom moſt do follow in this, had cited, and that as a Proof in Arguing. All that is replied to this is, That the Author of the <hi>Thirty fifth</hi> Sermon looked upon <hi>S. Gregory</hi> as miſtaken. But can that allow him to ſay, that no body writ <hi>Poſitively on that Subject,</hi> meaning only that they were miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? This is the Iſſue of that Controverſie which this <hi>Preface<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker</hi> ſtiles me <hi>Famous for:</hi> I leave it to your Judgment, Sir, whether my Defence doth not prove it a <hi>Calumny</hi> in the Miniſter who accuſed me, in citing this Sermon, of <hi>Diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Forgery.</hi> He knew well his weak Surmiſes, miſplaced by him for Arguments, could not make it out: therefore having eſpied in my Second Letter, that <hi>I reſolved to take no farther notice of ſuch unknown Masks or Perſons who concealed their Names, that their Errors when baffled, their Calumnies when cleared, may not put them to the Bluſh,</hi> he confidently puts out a Third Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without any the leaſt addition of a new Proof, and again conceals his Name, to ſecure himſelf from an Anſwer, which he knew I had publickly profeſſed I would not give, if he thus concealed his Name, and only repeated what I had Anſwered; then he moſt <hi>diſingenuouſly</hi> brags that I had dropt the Queſtion. Now, Sir, a full account of the Controverſie being thus given, obſerve the vain ſillineſs of the <hi>Preface-maker</hi>'s accuſing me of Forgery.</p>

That Catholics have every where, and even in this laſt Age, deſtroyed all Idols, and converted Nations from Idolatry, is a certain Truth; and therefore 'tis as evident a Calumny, that they have only changed the Names of Idols.

               <head>The Catholic Doctrin about Purgatory and Saints Interceſſion, and its evident Grounds oppoſed to Dr. <hi>Sherlock's</hi> Sophiſtical Cavils.</head>
               <p>WE call the Doctrin of Purgatory, <hi>God's Juſtice tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with infinite Mercy:</hi> And thô 'tis in our power, by the Mercy of God, to attain Salvation without ſuffering in Purgatory; yet we judge the Poſſeſſion of God ſo infinite a Good, that we believe that Man unworthy ever to ſee the Face of God, who declares with Dr. <hi>Sherlock,</hi> that did God offer him the Eternal poſſeſſion of himſelf on this Condition, that he ſhould firſt ſuffer a thouſand years, he would abſolutely refuſe it. We own two ſorts of Guilt in Sin; Firſt, an Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from God, and ſlighting of that infinite Good; Next, an Irregular Affection to ſome tranſient Good or Pleaſure, which the Prophet expreſſes by the forſaking the Fountain of living Waters, and ſeeking the leaking Ciſterns. To the Firſt is due, an Eternal loſs of God's Grace and Glory; to the Second, the Puniſhment of a ſenſible Pain. We believe, that thro' Chriſt we obtain full remiſſion of both Evils at once, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we are duely diſpoſed to receive it; to wit, when a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Contrition creates in us a full Converſion to God, and an equal deteſtation of all ſenſible Pleaſure, that may in the leaſt draw us from God. But when this Diſpoſition is but in a remiſs degree in us, God is yet ſo merciful, as thro' Chriſt to remit that firſt Guilt; and the Blood of Chriſt being particularly applied by the Sacrament of Penance, by the infuſion of his ſanctifying Grace, to make us his <hi>Friends,</hi> altho', becauſe we endeavor but weakly to be entirely ſuch, a ſenſible Pain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains due to us, to puniſh the paſt ſinful Pleaſure not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently mortified, either to be ſuffered by Penitential Works in this Life, or hereafter in Purgatory. A Man dying in the State of Grace indeed, but without a perfect Contrition, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſupplying and increaſing it by the due Fruits of Penance, may be called ſtill, (and is ſo termed by St. <hi>Hierom</hi>) a Sinner,<note place="margin">Hier in cap. 1.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51079:37"/> had time to comply with by a Penitential Life. In this Method of God's Judgments there appears but an unbiaſſed Juſtice, yet accompanied with a ſingular Mercy, by which God reſtores his Favor to us, before our Hearts be as perfectly converted as his Juſtice might well require. So God was merciful to the<note place="margin">Exod. 32. Hier. Ep. 12. ad Gaud.</note> 
                  <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when at <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Prayer he forgave them their paſt Sin of Idolatry, tho' as St. <hi>Hierom</hi> obſerves, he proteſted in his Juſtice, that he would puniſh that Sin in the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Thus he was merciful to <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted him that <hi>Our Lord had put away his Sin,</hi> yet Juſt in<note place="margin">2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 12.</note> puniſhing it by the death of his Child.

Thus it cleanſes from all Guilt of, and releaſes all Puniſhment due to Sin, by the Waters of Baptiſm; and following Sins by the Tears of Penance, or if thoſe flow more ſparingly than God requires, by the Fire of Purgatory.

               <p>But thoſe Puniſhments may laſt ſo long!

Different was the Senſe of the great Doctor St. <hi>Hilary: Since no one</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cum nemo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niens in conſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum ejus mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus ſit, quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do deſiderabile ejus poteſt eſſe judicium—in quo ſubeunda ſunt gravia illa expiandae à peccatis animae ſupplicia.</note> (ſays he) <hi>appears ſpotleſs before God, how can we meet his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with that hope and confidence, in which that unwearied Fire, and thoſe grievous Puniſhments are to be undergone, which Expiate a Soul from Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That there remains then after the Guilt of Sin is forgiven, ſuch an Obligation to undergo Puniſhment, to paſs by all the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers, all thoſe Texts of Scripture make it plain, which deliver unto us the neceſſity of Penance and its due Fruits. Now whoever goes out of this World, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſatisfied this Obligation, hath ſuch a moral unworthineſs, as bars him, till it be complied with, from the ſight of God. And thoſe who ſay, that it were a greater Mercy in God to remit all the Puniſhment due to Sin, blame Chriſt for Preaching Penance, and account him on that ſcore leſs merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. To ſay with Dr. <hi>Sherlock, That Men deſire nothing when they ask Pardon, but meerly not to be Puniſhed,</hi> is to declare, they value not Gods Love and Grace like Children, but meerly fear the Laſh like Slaves; and all Catholics look on ſuch a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, excluding poſitively all regard to Gods Grace and Love, as incapable of receiving forgiveneſs of Sins. Chriſt hath made Atonement for our Sins, but his Blood is to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Baptiſm, and in caſe of Relapſe, by perfect Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Penitential Works during Life, or Puniſhment after Death, before all Pain due to Sin be remitted; thus applied, it frees us from the <hi>whole Curſe of the Law.</hi> No Suffering or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51079:40"/> Puniſhment is the Death of the Soul, as Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> ſuppoſes, but only the privation of Gods Grace, which is her Life, and which is enjoyed through Chriſt as much in Purgatory as by penitent Saints on Earth in their penitential Sufferings; and the mercy of our Lord appears as much in purging his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers from all Stains of the leaſt ſin by the Fire of Purgatory, as here by the toilſom Labors of a penitential Life, ſuch as his deareſt Servants were ever purified by. St. <hi>Paul</hi> never taught, that <hi>all things</hi> that are not ſeen, or of another World, are E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or elſe God would be Eternally Judging, and ſo never Rewarding his Servants, or Puniſhing his Enemies; ſo that Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Demonſtration hath not ſo much as the leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a ſeeming Reaſon.</p>
               <p>Having thus repreſented our Faith, I conclude with <hi>S. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin</hi>

               <p>I have already Anſwered in the firſt Section, all thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies which are repeated here concerning the Bleſſed Saints Interceſſions for us.

We conceive Charity to be at leaſt as proper to, and inſeparable from the Seraphical Souls of Saints, as from any of Gods Servants on Earth, and as much inclining them to Pray for their Fellow-Members of Chriſt's Myſtical Body, engaged here below in Miſeries and Dangers. 3. We never required the Prayers of Saints, to render God good and merciful; but only when joyned with our Prayers, to render theſe a fitter Object of Gods Mercy, and to reconcile the Effects thereof to his Wiſdom and Juſtice. 4.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 48, 50, 51.</note> 
                  <hi>of Wood and Stone; becauſe he muſt be worſhipped in Spirit, he muſt not be worſhipped by any material or ſenſible Repreſentations. Thoſe words, Except your Righteouſneſs exceeds the Righteouſneſs of the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Scribes and Phariſees, you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, cuts off every thing that is External in Religion.</hi> Do not theſe Principles remit all Chriſtians to the <hi>Silent Meetings</hi> of <hi>Quakers?</hi> Exclude the uſe of Churches rather than Barns; Singing of Pſalms, and ſuch other material Repreſentations of the God whom we Praiſe?</p>
               <p>The Second. <hi>God and Chriſt are not preſent in the Aſſemblies</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 37.</note> 
                  <hi>of Chriſtians by any Figurative or Symbolical Preſence: There is no Symbolical Preſence of God under the Goſpel. 'Tis a great</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 34, 55.</note> 
                  <hi>Abſurdity to talk of more Symbolical Preſences of God than one: for a Symbolical Preſenc confines the unlimited Preſence of God to a certain Place in order to certain Ends; as for Example, to receive the Worſhip which is paid him. Now to have more than one ſuch Preſence as theſe, is like having more Gods than one.</hi> To ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the abſurdity of this Diſcourſe, which makes that Chriſtian an adorer of two Gods, who by Faith adoring God in Heaven and in his own Soul, worſhips him in both places; doth not this deſtroy the very Eſſence of your Sacrament, the Bread and Wine in the Lord's Supper, which you own to be a Symbolical Preſence of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>The Third. <hi>If God be better worſhipped before an Image than</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 53, 54.</note> 
                  <hi>without one, then the Worſhip of God is more confined to that Place where the Image is. I cannot ſee how to avoid this; whereas there is no appropriate Place of Worſhip under the Goſpel: And 'tis the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51079:45"/> ſame, tho' the Image be not appropriated to any Place, but carried about with us; for ſtill the Image makes the Place of Worſhip.</hi> This is an Argument for all Diſſenters from you, and all Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics againſt a <hi>Set Liturgy,</hi> a <hi>Set Form of Prayer:</hi> for if God be better worſhipped by a Set Form of Prayer than without it, then the Worſhip of God is more confined to that Place where that Set Form of Prayer, that Set Liturgy is uſed; and 'tis the ſame, tho' no ſet Place be appointed for that Set Form of Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Parallel is exact.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth.</hi> Having laid this Principle, <hi>All that is meerly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 34, 36.</note> 
                  <hi>External in Religion, is taken away, all Rites believed to be in themſelves Acts of Religion, and to render the Worſhipper acceptable to God; and this becauſe God muſt be worſhipped as a meer Spirit.</hi> To defend the uſe of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the Lord's Supper, he brings this only Reaſon: <hi>Mankind by Sin hath forfeited all natural Right to Gods Favor, they can challenge nothing but by Promiſe and Covenant, ſuch Covenants require a mutual Stipulation on both Sides; Therefore they muſt be tranſacted by ſome viſible and ſenſible Rites, whereby God obliges himſelf to us, and we to him.</hi> Is not this laſt Inference deſtroyed by the former Principle, taking away all <hi>Rites</hi> that are Acts of Religion, all that is meerly External? And on this Principle ought he not to teach, that the mutual Stipulation betwixt God and us, muſt be made by his interior Graces, and our interior Worſhip, becauſe God muſt be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as a meer Spirit? Upon whatever account that interi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Covenant requires a viſible ſenſible Mark, and our actual Communion with Chriſt another, all the Communications of Gods Graces to us, all our return of Worſhip and Adoration will equally admit of ſenſible Signs and Rites. To avoid far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prolixity, I will end with the following Principle of his, moſt injurious to Chriſt, and an open and never to be coloured Blaſphemy.</p>
               <p>Fifth Principle. <hi>There never was, never can be an Infallible</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fol.</hi> 68, 69, 70.</note> 
                  <hi>Judge; Chriſt himſelf was not an Infallible Judge, altho' he were an Infallible Teacher. I muſt my ſelf judge of his Doctrin, before I know that he is Infallible; therefore Men were to judge of Chriſt's Doctrin, before they believed him; and they are thus to this day to Examin his Doctrin by the Law and Prophets, and he never required that they ſhould ſubmit to his Infallible Authority
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51079:45"/> without Examination. He could not be an Infallible Judge, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging Men to receive all his Dictates as Divine Oracles, without Examination: 'Twas impoſſible to know him to be Infallible, but by judging of his Doctrin, by the agreement thereof with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Reaſon, and of former Revelations.</hi> Doth a Chriſtian teach this, and a Chriſtian approve and licenſe it! What, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> our God bleſſed for evermore, even when owned the Son of God, even from us Chriſtians, cannot exact a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Infallible Authority, without Examination of the truth of what he ſays, by comparing it with the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Human Reaſon! He cannot oblige us to receive all his Dictates as Divine Oracles! Was Chriſtian Faith, was the Author of it <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> ever thus affronted! Did the Apoſtles err, did they act againſt Senſe and Reaſon, when they believed what he had taught, of his Fleſh <hi>being meat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Joh. 6. v.</hi> 69.</note> only becauſe he <hi>had the words of Eternal Life,</hi> becauſe his Dictates were Divine Oracles? Were all men of this mind, Chriſt would not indeed find any Faith on Earth. What tho' we certainly know Chriſt to have taught and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared a Truth, muſt we not upon his word ſubmit to it and embrace it, till we have conſulted our Reaſon, and found it can object nothing againſt it? Were the weapons of S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5.</note> warfare ſuch as <hi>could humble what raiſed it ſelf againſt the ſcience of God, and bring into captivity all underſtanding in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt,</hi> and had the Word and Preaching of Chriſt leſs power? <hi>Chriſt teaches it</hi> is not yet a ſufficient Motive for me to believe? Should an Angel from Heaven teach me this, I would with St. <hi>Paul</hi> return him no other Anſwer than <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema;</hi> and do you, Sir, approve this? Do you Licenſe men to teach to Chriſtians, they are not to ſubmit to Chriſt's Word as to Divine Oracles; that they muſt make themſelves his Judges, and Examin by their Reaſon, whether he ſpoke truth or no? Well, Sir, were it but not to give occaſion to the ſpreading ſo horrid Blaſphemies againſt our Lord and God, I take my leave of you, and of ſuch Books Licenſed by you; and end with this Profeſſion of my Catholic Faith: <hi>Chriſt is an Infallible Judge, I muſt not Judge of his Doctrin, but believe it, and ſubmit to him; I ſubmit to his Infallible Authority without Examination; I receive all his Dictates as Divine Oracles.</hi> If,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51079:46"/> tho' Summoned by me, you ſtill refuſe to Subſcribe to this Doctrin, I will obey St. <hi>John</hi>'s Counſel, I will have nothing to do with you nor return to you ſo much as <hi>Ave,</hi> or any Greeting; but content my ſelf with Subſcribing to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of my Faith,</p>
